## 1. Business Context and Background

UbeROS delivers a browser-based ROS development environment through a Golden Layout
canvas of dockable panels (Simulator/noVNC, Terminal, Code Editor, ROS Status) served
behind a single Nginx reverse proxy. The Init milestone is functional: the full stack
launches with `docker compose up` and panels support drag, resize, minimize, tabs, and
pop-out.

With the core experience working, day-to-day use has surfaced usability gaps and defects
that reduce operator confidence: closed panels cannot be recovered, pop-out windows render
empty, terminal creation is limited, and there is no central control surface for the workspace.
Optional authentication is now wired into the proxy via `UBEROS_AUTH`, but UX controls are still
needed to make auth/session handling discoverable in the UI. Two open technical questions —
streaming smoothness and GPU/accelerator compatibility — also need
evidence before further investment.

This BRD captures the business needs for a coordinated workspace-management and operational-
controls improvement, plus two research spikes, while preserving the Init constraints
(single reverse proxy, backend ports internal, single-user now but multi-user not precluded).

## 2. Problem Statement and Business Drivers

### Problem Statement

Operators cannot reliably manage their UbeROS workspace: they lose panels with no recovery
path, cannot use pop-out windows effectively, cannot freely create and arrange terminals,
and have no central place to control layout, service health, or session/authentication.
These gaps erode trust in the environment and slow the develop-build-test loop.

### Business Drivers

| Driver | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| Operator productivity | Reduce friction and lost work in the daily ROS develop-build-test loop. |
| Reliability and recovery | Provide recovery paths when panels are closed or services become unresponsive. |
| Extensibility | Establish a control surface that future capabilities (multi-user, bag record/replay) can plug into without rework. |
| Security readiness | Make the documented optional authentication real and toggleable ahead of any non-localhost exposure. |
| Evidence-based decisions | De-risk streaming smoothness and hardware acceleration choices with structured research. |

## 3. Business Objectives and Success Metrics

| Objective ID | Objective | KPI / Success Metric | Baseline | Target | Timeframe | Priority |
|--------------|-----------|----------------------|----------|--------|-----------|----------|
| BO-1 | No workspace state is unrecoverable | A closed panel can always be reopened from a control | Not possible today | 100% of panel types reopenable | This iteration | Must |
| BO-2 | Pop-out windows are fully usable | Popped-out panel shows live content without a dock/undock workaround | Empty on pop-out | Content visible on pop-out (qualitative) | This iteration | Must |
| BO-3 | Flexible terminal management | Operator can create N terminals and dock/undock/pop-out each | Fixed set, no + control | Create, dock-together, undock, and pop-out terminals | This iteration | Must |
| BO-4 | Central operational control | Menu exposes show/hide, layouts, service reset, and logout | No menu | Menu present with all four control groups | This iteration | Must |
| BO-5 | Optional authentication is real | `UBEROS_AUTH` toggles proxy auth without code edits | Toggle implemented; UI session affordances still limited | Toggle enables/disables auth via `.env` | This iteration | Should |
| BO-6 | Evidence for streaming and hardware | Documented research comparing Guacamole vs noVNC and Intel/OpenVINO feasibility; implement OpenVINO if feasible | None | Guacamole research write-up; OpenVINO write-up plus implementation if feasible | This iteration | Should |

## 4. Stakeholders and Roles

| Stakeholder | Role | Interest |
|-------------|------|----------|
| jmservera | Product owner / sponsor | Prioritizes work, accepts deliverables |
| ROS Developer (primary persona) | End user | Daily workspace usability and recovery |
| Platform Maintainer | Operator | Service reset, layout, auth configuration |
| Squad (Morpheus, Neo, Trinity, Switch, Tank) | Delivery team | Design and implementation |

> TODO: Confirm which stakeholder owns/reviews each requirement.

## 5. Scope

### In Scope

- Panel recovery via a control surface (reopen closed panels/tabs).
- Fix for empty pop-out windows.
- Terminal session management (create, dock together, undock, pop-out).
- A workspace system menu: show/hide windows, predefined layouts, service reset, logout.
- Menu extensibility hooks for future features (multi-user, bag record/replay).
- Optional proxy authentication toggled by `.env` (`UBEROS_AUTH`), with logout clearing credentials.
- Guacamole vs noVNC research spike as a documented deliverable (research only).
- Intel GPU/OpenVINO research spike, plus implementation of the OpenVINO overlay if feasible.

### Out of Scope

- Implementing multi-user identity, self-service user management, or bag record/replay in this iteration (menu must only leave room for them).
- Implementing Guacamole in this iteration; if the research concludes it is better, implementation is a separately approved future improvement.
- Changing the single-reverse-proxy topology or host-publishing backend ports.

### Assumptions

- Init constraints hold: single ingress, backend ports internal, single-user now with multi-user not precluded (PRD A-1, A-2).
- Golden Layout v2 remains the window manager (ADR-004).
- Nginx `auth_basic` remains the Init auth mechanism (ADR-005); OAuth2-Proxy is a later upgrade.

## 6. Current and Future Business Processes

### Current State

- Closing a panel/tab removes it permanently; the only reset is clearing saved layout or reloading defaults.
- Pop-out opens a browser window that renders empty until the panel is re-docked.
- Terminals are a fixed set; there is no control to spawn a new session.
- There is no menu; layout, service health, and auth are managed outside the UI.
- `UBEROS_AUTH` can already toggle proxy basic authentication, but auth/session controls remain mostly outside the UI flow.

### Future State

- A control (menu) lists all panels and lets the operator reopen any closed panel.
- Pop-out windows render live content immediately.
- A `+` control creates terminal sessions; each can be docked together, undocked, or popped out independently.
- A system menu provides show/hide, predefined layouts, per-service reset, and logout (when auth is enabled), with room for future features.
- Setting `UBEROS_AUTH=basic` in `.env` enables proxy authentication; unset/`none` disables it, no code edits required.

## 7. Business Requirements

| BR ID | Description | Linked Objective | Stakeholders | Acceptance Criteria | Priority |
|-------|-------------|------------------|--------------|---------------------|----------|
| BR-001 | Operators can reopen any panel or tab after closing it. | BO-1 | ROS Developer | After closing any panel, a control lists it and reopening restores a working panel of that type. | Must |
| BR-002 | Pop-out ("open in new window") shows live panel content immediately. | BO-2 | ROS Developer | A popped-out panel displays working content without requiring dock/undock; verified for simulator, terminal, editor. | Must |
| BR-003 | Operators can create a new terminal session from a `+` control. | BO-3 | ROS Developer | Activating `+` opens an additional independent PTY without disturbing existing terminals. | Must |
| BR-004 | Terminal sessions can be docked together, undocked independently, and popped out as independent windows. | BO-3 | ROS Developer | Each terminal can be grouped, separated, and opened as its own window while its process keeps running. | Must |
| BR-005 | A system menu lets operators hide and show windows. | BO-1, BO-4 | ROS Developer | Menu toggles visibility of each panel; hidden panels can be shown again. | Must |
| BR-006 | The menu offers four predefined layouts the operator can apply: (1) default four equal panels, (2) simulator enlarged, (3) code editor enlarged, (4) terminal enlarged. | BO-4 | ROS Developer | Selecting any of the four presets rearranges panels to that preset. | Should |
| BR-007 | The menu can reset/restart any individual service (ros, simulator, editor, vnc, frontend) when it becomes unresponsive. | BO-4 | Platform Maintainer | Selecting reset for any service recovers it without a full stack restart; other services keep running. | Must |
| BR-008 | The menu provides logout when authentication is enabled, clearing stored credentials. | BO-4, BO-5 | Platform Maintainer | When `UBEROS_AUTH` is on, logout clears browser-stored credentials and requires re-authentication; when off, the action is hidden or disabled. | Should |
| BR-009 | The menu architecture is extensible for future capabilities (multi-user login/logout, self user management, bag record/replay). | BO-4 | Squad | New menu actions can be added without redesigning the menu; documented extension point exists. | Should |
| BR-010 | Proxy authentication is optional and controlled by `.env` (`UBEROS_AUTH`) with no code changes. | BO-5 | Platform Maintainer | With `UBEROS_AUTH=basic` and an `.htpasswd`, requests prompt for credentials; with it off, no prompt appears. | Must |
| BR-011 | Deliver a research write-up comparing Apache Guacamole to noVNC, focused on streaming performance/smoothness (including GPU impact); implementation deferred to a future improvement if Guacamole proves better. | BO-6 | Squad | Documented comparison with a recommendation and rationale, referencing the current noVNC setup; no implementation this iteration. | Should |
| BR-012 | Investigate Intel GPU and OpenVINO compatibility for the simulator overlay (using the referenced Intel GPU compose override as a starting point) and implement the OpenVINO overlay if feasible. | BO-6 | Squad | Documented feasibility vs the current NVIDIA overlay; if feasible, a working Intel/OpenVINO compose override is delivered. | Should |

## 8. Risks and Mitigations

| Risk | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|--------|------------|
| Pop-out fix interacts with iframe same-origin/BroadcastChannel behavior | Regressions in live panels | Verify against S5 pop-out isolation acceptance |
| Enabling auth breaks WebSocket routes (rosbridge, noVNC, ttyd) | Loss of core functionality | Apply auth consistently across all proxied WebSocket locations; test with auth on and off |
| Service reset partially restarts dependencies | Inconsistent state | Define per-service reset semantics and health verification |
| OpenVINO implementation proves infeasible | Wasted effort | Time-box BR-012 to research first; implement only if a clean overlay path exists |
| Guacamole research triggers premature rework | Scope creep | Keep BR-011 research-only; defer any implementation to a separately approved future improvement |

## 9. Resolved Decisions

1. Research scope: Guacamole (BR-011) is research-only; implementation deferred to a future improvement if it proves better. OpenVINO (BR-012) is implemented this iteration if feasible.
2. Predefined layouts (BR-006): four presets — default four equal panels, simulator enlarged, code editor enlarged, terminal enlarged.
3. Service reset (BR-007): covers all services (ros, simulator, editor, vnc, frontend).
4. Priority order: bugs first (BR-001, BR-002, BR-010), then the new features.
5. Pop-out target (BO-2): qualitative — content visible on pop-out, no numeric threshold.
6. Logout (BR-008): clears stored credentials and forces re-authentication.
