# UberOS Acceptance Tests (WP-15)

Machine-verification of the six Initial Success Criteria (S1–S6) from
[`docs/specs/01-Init.md`](../docs/specs/01-Init.md) against a **running** stack.

## Prerequisites

- The stack is up and healthy: from the repo root run `docker compose up -d`.
- Node.js 18+ (uses the built-in `fetch`).
- Docker CLI available on `PATH` (the S1/S5/S6 checks inspect container state).

## Install

```bash
cd tests
npm install
npx playwright install chromium
```

## Run

```bash
# Fast curl-style smoke (S1 health + proxy routing)
npm run smoke          # cross-platform (Node fetch)
./smoke.sh             # bash/curl variant for CI

# Full browser acceptance suite (S1–S6)
npm test
npm run report         # open the HTML report
```

Override the ingress with `UBEROS_PORT` or `UBEROS_BASE_URL` if you changed the
proxy port.

## Criteria mapping

| Criterion | Spec intent | Machine-testable check | File |
|-----------|-------------|------------------------|------|
| S1 | `docker compose up` starts all services without error | All 7 services report `healthy`; `/healthz` returns `200 "ok"` | `acceptance/s1-stack-health.spec.js` |
| S2 | Window manager with ≥ 1 panel | Root returns 200; ≥ 1 `iframe.panel-frame[src]` in the DOM | `acceptance/s2-window-manager.spec.js` |
| S3 | ROS command in a terminal shows output | ttyd endpoint serves; `/rosout` visible via rosbridge within 5s | `acceptance/s3-terminal-ros.spec.js` |
| S4 | Simulator GUI visible in noVNC | Non-blank noVNC canvas within 30s (> 5% non-black pixels) | `acceptance/s4-novnc-frame.spec.js` |
| S5 | Pop-out does not terminate the session | All services stay healthy after a detached window closes | `acceptance/s5-popout-isolation.spec.js` |
| S6 | Editor opens, edits, saves in the ROS workspace | A file written via the editor container is readable from the ROS container | `acceptance/s6-editor-workspace.spec.js` |

S4 also exercises SPIKE-A P5 (software-rendered Gazebo reaching a browser frame).
